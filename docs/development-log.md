# Development log

Newest entries first. Each entry records what was implemented, the tests
that cover it, and decisions worth remembering. Future contributors (human
or agent): read `docs/architecture.md` first, then the latest entries here,
then `docs/roadmap.md` for what to build next.

## 2026-06-11 — Windows link fixes + GitHub releases on tag push

### Implemented

- Fixed the Windows shell link, found by reading CI logs after four
  distinct failures (all in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`):
  1. strip `/defaultlib:` linker-flag tokens from rustc's
     `native-static-libs` output (CMake treated them as file paths);
  2. strip ANSI color codes from that output (`CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always`
     in CI poisons tokens) — note `\x` escapes are invalid in CMake
     strings, use `string(ASCII 27 …)`;
  3. resolve `libmupdf.lib`/`libthirdparty.lib` to their cargo `OUT_DIR`
     paths — on Windows rustc does **not** bundle them into the staticlib
     (unlike Linux), leaving 382 unresolved `fz_*` symbols;
  4. configure the Windows CI shell build as Release — a debug config
     links debug Qt + `/MDd` against MuPDF's `/MD` objects (LNK2038).
- **`publish-release`** (release.yml): on `v*` tag pushes, downloads the
  portable zip artifact and publishes it to a GitHub release as
  `syodep-vX.Y.Z-win64.zip` (`gh release create --generate-notes`,
  `contents: write` permission). Manual dispatch runs still stop at
  workflow artifacts.

### Test strategy

CI-only changes, verified by watching runs to green: full CI (all six
jobs including both Windows jobs), a `workflow_dispatch` release run
producing a working zip, and a `v*` tag push producing a GitHub release.

## 2026-06-11 — Windows binary in CI/CD

### Implemented

- **`qt-build-windows`** (ci.yml): builds the Qt shell on `windows-2022`
  on every push/PR — Qt 6.7.3 via `jurplel/install-qt-action`
  (`win64_msvc2019_64`), MSVC env via `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd`,
  `cmake -G Ninja`, then the offscreen smoke test. The exe is a
  GUI-subsystem binary, so the smoke test asserts the exit code (stdout is
  invisible on Windows).
- **`release-build-windows`** (release.yml): release-mode build, portable
  tree staged with `windeployqt --release --no-translations` plus LICENSE/
  README/sample config, smoke test re-run from the staged tree with Qt
  stripped from PATH (an incomplete DLL bundle fails in CI, not on a user
  machine), `syodep-win64.zip` uploaded as a workflow artifact.

### Test strategy

CI-only change: no core logic touched, so no new Rust tests. The Windows
smoke test (build + open + render through the real exe) plus the staged
PATH-stripped smoke test are the appropriate coverage. Verified by pushing
and watching the GitHub Actions runs to green, plus a `workflow_dispatch`
release run producing a working zip.

### Notes / remaining

- Qt version is pinned (6.7.3) in both workflows; bump deliberately.
- Still planned (docs/packaging.md): Linux AppImage, NSIS installer,
  attaching artifacts to GitHub releases on tag push.

## 2026-06-11 — Milestone 1: MVP foundation

Everything below landed as one milestone, built bottom-up in small slices
(config → core input/layout → storage → pdf backend → App integration →
FFI → Qt shell → build system → CI/docs).

### Implemented

- **Workspace layout**: Cargo workspace with `syodep-config`,
  `syodep-core`, `syodep-pdf`, `syodep-storage`, `syodep-ffi`; Qt shell in
  `ui-qt/`; top-level CMake driving cargo + Qt.
- **syodep-config**: TOML config (`[view]`, `[keys]`), defaults, overlay
  semantics for user keybindings, descriptive parse errors (unknown field,
  type mismatch, file context), and the key-chord syntax/parser
  (`gg`, `<C-d>`, `<C-A-Left>`, named keys).
- **syodep-core**:
  - `Command` registry (19 commands) with name round-tripping.
  - Input state machine: keymap trie, count prefixes (`5j`, `120G`,
    Vim-style `0` rule), multi-key sequences, deterministic prefix
    disambiguation, Escape-cancels-pending, per-entry error reporting for
    invalid bindings.
  - Layout/View: document-space page stacking with gaps and centering,
    clamped scrolling (small docs centered), current-page = window center,
    page navigation, zoom anchored at the window center with limits,
    fit-width, visible-page computation.
  - Byte-bounded LRU render cache keyed by (page, quantized scale).
  - `App`: ties everything together; `Effects {redraw, quit,
    open_file_dialog}` out; position autosave after navigation + on drop.
- **syodep-pdf**: safe wrapper over the `mupdf` crate exposing only
  syodep types (`Document`, `Size`, `Bitmap` RGBA8, `OutlineItem`);
  open-from-path/bytes, page sizes, render-at-scale with white background,
  plain-text extraction, outline; password-protected files rejected with a
  clear error. Includes a programmatic PDF fixture builder
  (`test_support`, also used by other crates and CI).
- **syodep-storage**: rusqlite (bundled), migration runner over
  `PRAGMA user_version` (refuses newer-schema DBs), schema v1
  (`documents` keyed by SHA-256 content fingerprint, `positions`),
  position save/load, cascade delete.
- **syodep-ffi**: panic-safe C ABI (`syo_app_*`), cbindgen-generated
  header, explicit free functions for strings/bitmaps, default
  config/db path helpers (XDG / %APPDATA%).
- **ui-qt**: `MainWindow` (status bar, file dialog, owns the core handle),
  `CanvasWidget` (QOpenGLWidget; paints core-provided bitmaps, forwards
  keys/wheel/resize), `key_encoder` (QKeyEvent → chord strings),
  `--smoke-test` mode for CI.
- **Build**: top-level CMake builds the Rust staticlib via cargo and links
  the Qt shell against it (Linux: + fontconfig/freetype; Windows libs
  prepared). `SYODEP_RUST_PROFILE` defaults to release.
- **CI**: lint (fmt, clippy -D warnings), tests on Linux + Windows, Qt
  build + offscreen smoke test, docs-consistency script
  (`scripts/check-docs.sh`). Release workflow placeholder with the real
  pipeline specified in `docs/packaging.md`.
- **Docs**: README + architecture/commands/keybindings/config/testing/
  packaging/roadmap/this log.

### Test strategy actually used

TDD for the pure crates (tests written with/before the code, all pure
logic covered without I/O where possible); integration tests at the App
and FFI levels; generated PDF fixtures instead of binary files; offscreen
smoke test for the shell. 88 tests at milestone close. Deviation from
strict TDD: the Qt shell itself is covered by compilation + smoke test
only, by design (it contains no logic).

### Decisions (details in `docs/architecture.md`)

- `mupdf-rs` bindings instead of hand-rolled bindgen (reproducible
  Windows/Linux builds; unsafe stays out of our tree).
- Content-fingerprint document identity (survives moves/renames).
- Scroll state stored in document space → zoom-stable.
- Timer-free key disambiguation (wait on ambiguous prefix; Esc cancels).
- Synchronous rendering for M1; async/tiles deferred to phase 3.

### Known limitations / next steps

- Rendering is synchronous on the UI thread; large pages at high zoom can
  stutter. Planned: phase 3 async tiles (the `App::render_page` seam stays).
- `visible_pages` FFI is capped at 64 entries by the shell's stack buffer
  (fine until extreme zoom-out; the API already reports the real count).
- No text selection yet — phase 2 starts with the char-geometry text layer.
- ~~Windows CI builds the Rust workspace but not yet the Qt shell~~
  (done: see "Windows binary in CI/CD" entry above).
